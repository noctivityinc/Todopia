    If you are here it's probably cause Wayne Seguin told you to stop by.  This is a 
    WORK IN PROGRESS and also open source :)  You can get it on Github.

    The idea is simple - an ultra slick taggable todo-list that is sharable BY TAGS.  So you 
    can RAPIDLY add todos, tag em, filter by em, blah blah.  But say you and a buddy are working 
    on a project.  Well tag it as @project and then he will have access to it also (not yet, soon :).

    Oh yeah, and its iPad/iPhone friendly as well plus you can use your keyboard for the entire thing.
